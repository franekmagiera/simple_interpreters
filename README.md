# Simple Interpreters

A simple repository with simple interpreters :)

- `simple_arithmetic` was prompted by [dabeaz's article](https://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/) on coroutines in Python that made me want to play around with that stuff
- `lisr` is supposed to be a simple LISP interpreter written in Rust, which main goal is to make me to dabble in some Rust programming
