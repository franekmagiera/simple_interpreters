# LISR

`lisr` is a simple LISP interpreter written in Rust. It lacks a lot of functionality and performance that you would expect from a modern programming language but it can evaluate a lot of cool programs (and was a lot of fun to write!).

Check out the `interepret` module's test for some real-life-like examples.
